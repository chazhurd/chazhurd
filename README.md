#Software Engineer
I consider myself to know a little about a lot. My repositories represent about 50% of what I have done, and if you go through it you will see its mainly UX and Java apps. I am familiar with Java, C#, Node.JS, ASP.Net, MVC, JavaFX, Verilog, C, Linux, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, Python (Big Data), Android and OpenGL. Other than software I am a professional painter, who remodels houses. I work on my cars, as far as the timing belt to simple oil changes. I converted 120 to 220 at my house where needed. Built irragation systems in my back yard to house dozens of plants. The list goes on, I love life and look forward to my future career in SDE.
